# Connecting-The-Dots-In-RTL_28-Days-Programming-Challenge.
Upholding the RTL journey

My VLSI Learning Journey  
About 
This repository documents my 28-day journey learning digital design and Verilog HDL from scratch. Building digital circuits day by day to master RTL design.

Current Status 
- Duration: 28 days
- Progress: Just started - Goal: Master digital circuit design
- Skills I'm Learning - Verilog RTL Design - Digital Circuit Design  - Simulation & Verification - FPGA Implementation Basics  Learning Path -

    - Week 1: Combinational Circuits (Gates, MUX, ALU, etc.) -
    - Week 2: Sequential Circuits (Flip-flops, Counters, Registers) -
    -  Week 3: Memory & FSM Design (RAM, FIFO, State Machines) -
    -  Week 4: System Integration (UART, Projects
       
- Getting Started Each folder contains Verilog code with testbenches for digital circuits.
-  Learning Log I'm building circuits daily and documenting my progress here.
